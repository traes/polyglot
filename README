Purpose
-------

These are simple webpages for practicing Spanish and Portuguese verbs.

No external servers or databases are required, so you can also practice offline if you download the files to your harddisk.

Usage
-----

When opening the page for a language in a browser (e.g es.html for spanish), it gives you a verb, time and person.

If you fill in the correct conjugation, you get a point.
You can see your current score a the top right of the page.

In case you give a wrong answer, the page will display the table of conjugations.
You can then enter a correction, but you will not receive any points.
